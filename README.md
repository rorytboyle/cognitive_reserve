# Functions
_create_cogRes_composites_ = Creates standardised composite measures of CR proxies. For example, given 7 cognitive reserve proxy measures, this code will standardise each proxy measure (i.e. z-score), and create every possible combination of each measure, resulting in 127 unique cognitive reserve measures.

_score_IPAQ_short_ = Scores answers from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ)

_make_interaction_plot_ = Creates interaction plots so that the moderation effects of a cognitive reserve variable can be visualised.

_score_CRIq_ = Scores answers from online versions of the Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (Nucci et al., 2012)

_score_CSAQ_frequency_ = Scores answers from Cognitively Stimulating Activities Questionnaire (Wilson et al., 2003)

_score_SNI_Cohen_ = Scores answers from Social Network Index (Cohen et al., 1997)
