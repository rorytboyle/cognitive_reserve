Code for measuring cognitive reserve using behavioural and neuroimaging data

# Functions
_create_cogRes_composites_ = Given 7 cognitive reserve proxy measures, this code will standardise each proxy measure (i.e. z-score), and create every possible combination of each measure, resulting in 127 unique cognitive reserve measures.

_score_IPAQ_short_ = Scores answers from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ)

_make_interaction_plot_ = Creates interaction plots so that the moderation effects of a cognitive reserve variable can be visualised.

_score_CRIq_ = Scores answers from online versions of the Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (Nucci et al., 2012)

# To-do
~1) Edit create_cogRes_composites.py so that a variable number of proxies can be used instead of strictly 7~
